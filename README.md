# 105-Unit-3
This repository takes data from the 2014-2015 County Health Data and provides instructional steps on how to filter and merge the data into new subsets. With new subsets created, researchers are able to narrow the data into specific fields such as unemployment, air poullution, and region. This makes it easier to provide analysis on what was once a large data set.

The Data folder in the repository includes:
1. The instructions including the Python3 code used to access and filter the data
2. The original data set called CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv
3. The new combined subset called CompiledData.csv
