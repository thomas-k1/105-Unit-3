# Analyzing County Health Data
## Purpose of this Repository
This repository takes data from the 2014-2015 County Health Data and provides instructional steps on how to filter and merge the data into new subsets. With new subsets created, researchers are able to narrow the data into specific fields such as unemployment, air poullution, and region. This makes it easier to provide analysis on what was before a large data set.

The Data folder in the repository includes:
1. The instructions including the Python3 code used to access and filter the data
2. The original data set called CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv
3. The new combined subset called CompiledData.csv

## Instructions
1. Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/).
2. Open JupyterLab via Anaconda Navigator.
3. Copy the files in the Data folder into your own directory and open them in JupyterLab.

## Visualizations
With a subset created to your liking, visualizations can be generated. The following map was created using [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) by importing the example subset. The map shows the population not proficient in English on a density map of the US, making it much easier to interpret the data. States with higher proportions are clearly distinguished from states with lower proportions using color. The map shows that Texas, Arizona, and Washington have a large proportion of non-English speakers to English speakers.
